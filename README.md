# College-Admission
## Problem Statement:
An education department in the US needs to analyze the factors that influence the
admission of a student into a college. Analyze the historical data and determine the
key drivers.
Analysis information:
Predictive:
 - Run logistic model to determine the factors that influence the admission process
   of a student (Drop insignificant variables)
 - Transform variables to factors wherever required
 - Calculate accuracy of the model
 - Try other modeling techniques like decision tree and SVM and select a champion
   model
 - Determine the accuracy rates for each model
 - Select the most accurate model
 - Identify other Machine learning or statistical techniques that can be used
Descriptive:
 - Categorize the grade point average into High, Medium, and Low (with admission
   probability percentages) and plot it on a point chart
